            <Text>
                <content> The IETF meetings tend to become too large, creating logistics and planning problems.
                    I suggest that future meetings are held for two weeks, with applications and user services issues the first week, and all other issues the second week.
                    Those who so wish could attend both weeks, and other people could attend only one week.
                    Those who choose to attend both weeks would be able to cover more groups and do better liaisons between the different areas.
                    The Friday of the first week could discuss applications issues which might be of special interest to the other areas, and the Monday of the second week would schedule other groups which might be of special interest to applications people, so some people could attend Monday-Monday or Friday-Friday.

                <content>My problem over the past year or so is that there are only a few session I wish to attend, but I cannot know for sure when they will be scheduled, so I cannot make reasonable travel arrangements (a week in Orlando for 6 hours of meetings is hard to sell to management).
                    Now I know there is a rationale here, and that one is encouraged to participate broadly.
                    And I am hopeful that new activities (my own and in the IETF) will give me many more reasons to attend.
                    But firmer scheduling would be a big win.

                    Terry,
                    WG Chairs already are asked to specify which clashes they want to avoid, but clash avoidance is an iterative problem.
                    I just don't see how late changes can be completely avoided.
                    Obviously, everybody knows they need to be minimised.
                    Jacob,
                    No way.
                    Taking one week out of our calendars 3 times a year is already very painful, and a lot of people really do need and want to track multiple areas of the IETF.
                    Spreading it thinner would be awful.

            <Subject>create 'final' IETF agenda schedule earlier?</Subject>
            <Text>
                <content>Working groups don't seem to decide at the last minute whether or not they need a meeting, or what their conflict avoidance criteria needs to be.
                    This leads me to believe that we could create the IETF schedule earlier without causing significant pain.
                    For example, it would be very useful so that the final WG schedule was available more than 21 days in advance, in order to get advanced purchase tickets.
                    This would mean that the apps area schedule should be set tentatively 30-35 days in advance, so that the draft IETF schedule could be published and conflicts reviewed.

                    Many folks in smaller companies are under severe budget constraints and have difficulty justifying participation in IETF meetings.
                    The advance notice helps reduce travel costs, which in turn helps more people attend.
                    It would make my life easier.

                    - I can't get at the results either with Opera or Lynx.
                    Yes, please, an update to the list of the data would be beneficial to us who do not maintain the same browsers or have the same capabilities as those who coded that very, very interesting albeit ironic poll.

                <content>The poll is halfway down on the right hand side of the page.
                    Sorry, the page was designed by a person with idea on usability.
                    A perennial portal problem...
                    The poll is just visible without scrolling down, underneath the Internet Works magazine image.
                    Are you viewing in graphics browser?
                    Does anyone need better directions?

                    That's rather ironic considering the question.

                    Answers have gotten better.
                    Web Site Accessibility
                    Is your Web site accessible to the disabled?
                    percent
                    1.) Yes 22%
                    2.) No - but it will be within the next 12 months 15%
                    3.) No - and I can't see the point of doing so 16%
                    4.) No - it would be too difficult to do 6%
                    5.) Not sure - How do I do it? 41%

                    Somebody on the list emailed the website yesterday to find out.
                    Maybe if the site responds, he'll forward the answer to the list.

                <content>And that person is still waiting to hear from the Webmaster.
                    I would also like to apologise for not posting the final results but Internet problems prevented me from accessing the site...
                    that was my end of things and not the site that was having problems.
                    I will email again today and see if I can get an answer for the list.
                    Further apologies for those who could not access the poll, but I think that this is often typical of sites that run articles or polls on accessibility, and a complaint has been logged with the site.
                    Kind regards
                    Simon

                    hi all,
                    As outlined at the face to face meet, I've been working on methods of getting coordinate information about the locations of Semantic web researchers and groups.
                    I wrote to the www-rdf-interest list asking for data:
                    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/2003Apr/0252.html
                    so we'll have to see how that pans out.
                    Please do add yourselves if you've not already there (I just did a few as examples).
                    There are some SVG demos, developed from ones by Jim Ley, displaying the information we have already, which I constructed as examples:
                    http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/200303/geo/intro.html#demos
                    So, now we have to decide on the map which we will use to overlay the dots on.
                    We want something that will highlight Europe, especially since on a world map, Europe is too small to really show up on provide the level of detail we require.
                    At ILRT, Caroline Meek, Dan and I have had discussions with a designer, and he has pointed us at some examples, and we've narrowed it down to two that we rather like:
                    http://www.cadmium.co.uk/thumbs/brand%20x/maps%20and%20globes/t_bxp_c31027.jpg.jpg
                    which has the advantage of showing Europe as part of the world (we could get rid of the arm of the globe that is showing, and alter the colours);
                    and http://www.cadmium.co.uk/thumbs/ds/maps%20and%20globes/t_11407324.jpg.jpg
                    which would be technically simpler to do, but shows Europe in isolation (I do like the colour scheme though).
                    Do people have a preference for one style over the other?
                    Could you let us know today if possible?
                    We need to specify the map as soon as possible in order to get postcards printed for www2003.
                    thanks,
                    Libby
                    p.s. Here's a nice similar idea:

                    Can't say I'm particularly grabbed by either of them, but if you have to pick one I'd go for the map, not the globe.
                    Is there any reason it has to be geographically accurate?
                    Perhaps a schematic, analogous to the London Underground map of London, would allow you to convey the sense of spatial distribution without getting hung up on the scale problem.
                    Of course, you may not consider that a helpful suggestion given the short timescale :-)

                    One advantage of being geographically accurate is it simplifies our lives when we try to plot SW researchers, groups, events etc on the map...
                    I prefer the map to the globe, fwiw.

                <content>yeah, sorry it's such a rush.
                    It took a long time to write the document explaining how to write the RDF.
                    At this stage we really need examples to show the designer though
                    - I'll pass your comments along to him, see if he has anything like that.
                    What don't you like about them in particular?
                    thanks for the feedback

                    Hi Libby,
                    The globe is too visually busy for a background (imho), and if you decrease the opacity I think you'll lose too much of the important bits (like where the UK is :-).
                    The map would be OK as a backdrop for the FOAF map if it was semi-opaque, but (a) it misses out the rest of the world, as you said yourself, and (b) there's a big blue empty space on the left :-).
                    The atlantic is just too big** if you keep it to scale, hence my suggestion to use more of a schematic approach.
                    I guess you need the cartographical equivalent of an ellipsis, whatever that might be!
                    Cheers,
                    Ian

                    thanks Ian.
                    I broadly agree with you.
                    For (b) though, that might work in our favour, as we can put a logo and/or a slogan there.

                    a &amp;quot;heads-up&amp;quot;.
                    Hoping that we will have a last call review shortly (see my next email) we are planning a face to face meeting at which we can resolve issues raised, and generally tidy the document up (write up lots more good techniques).
                    At the moment we are talking to a potential host in the Boston area about a meeting on thursday and friday 7-8 October.
                    More details as they come to hand.
                    cheers

                    Folks,
                    please note that this meeting would be on at the same time as the ATIA meeting in Orlando, Florida.
                    If the time is impossible for anyone please let us know as soon as possible
                    - at the moment the next closest possible times are a week earlier (which will cut into the time available for last call review) or ten days later (which will possibly push our schedule back further).
                    cheers

                    Folks,
                    please note that this meeting would be on at the same time as the ATIA meeting in Orlando, Florida.
                    If the time is impossible for anyone please let us know as soon as possible
                    - at the moment the next closest possible times are a week earlier (which will cut into the time available for last call review) or ten days later (which will possibly push our schedule back further).

                    Hello,
                    I have other meetings tentatively scheduled for 6 and 7 October in Boston.
                    I would probably be able to attend starting the 7th.
                    - Ian

                    Dear working group participants,
                    as discussed, the meeting will indeed be held on thursday 7 and friday 8 October.
                    I am pleased to announce that Allaire Corp will be our hosts, and look forward to a productive two days, and some time to say hi.
                    The nitty-gritty...
                    Meeting registration is open from now until 1 October.
                    register via the meeting page at http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/f2f-oct99 which also provides details on location, accommodation, etc.
                    There are a limited number of rooms available in the Royal Sonesta Hotel (which is the meeting venue) at a discounted rate
                    - in order to qualify for this rate reservations and meeting registration must be completed by September 10.
                    Since October is the peak season for Boston hotels, rooms are expensive and hotels book out early, so you are advised to make your plans and reservations as soon as possible.
                    If you have any questions or special requirements please contact me as early as possible.
                    Cheers
                    Charles McCN

                    Most important - if you haven't registered yet, don't forget.
                    http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/f2f-oct99 for the details.
                    Given that there are a small number of us, I thought I would ask what people want to eat for lunch.
                    The default choices are roast turkey breast with vegetables (without turkey if you are a vegan), and pasta with vegetable rataouille.
                    Possible substitutions:
                    baked Scrod (fish)
                    chicken caesar salad
                    hommus roll-up sandwich with salad
                    salad with crab cakes
                    churrasco flank steak with chimichurri (??) and onions
                    I will do this in the following way:
                    If you cannot eat one of these things please make that very clear.
                    It will take at least two votes to change something, and will have to be compatible with what people can't do.
                    The deadline is 3pm (boston time) Monday.
                    No response will not be considered a vote for the default
                    - it will be considered a vote for &amp;quot;whatever gets chosen&amp;quot;
                    Sorry to bore you with administrivia, but I figure that having food that people like helps the meeting go well...
                    cheers

                    We are trying to do advanced planning for a F2F in September.
                    Because of the membership overlap with the OASIS BPEL TC, we would like to try and co-locate with their meetings.
                    This is not a joint meeting, and is being proposed purely to ease travel logistics and members' costs.
                    The OASIS TC is proposing to meet 17 (afternoon), 18, and 19 September, either in Seattle or Germany.
                    Thus it makes sense to try and meet on 15, 16, and 17 (Morning) September.
                    Can people check their diaries for these dates and inform the chairs asap.
                    SAP have offered to host the meeting in Germany (thanks Kevin), but should the BPEL TC decide to meet in Seattle, we would need to find a host.
                    Offers gratefully accepted.
                    Cheers,
                    Martin.

                    Could we investigate trying the next week?

                    It's certainly possible, but we shouldn't get into an n-phase transaction:
                    if its in germany those that want to attend both meetings get a weekend in Heidelburg.
                    If BPEl decides to meet in Seattle I'm not sure many would have such a weekend stayover.
                    Of course of bpel meet the following week ...
                    You see where I'm going with this!

                    The OASIS TC is proposing to meet 17 (afternoon), 18, and 19 September, either in Seattle or Germany.
                    Thus it makes sense to try and meet on 15, 16, and 17 (Morning) September.
                    Can people check their diaries for these dates and inform the chairs asap.

                    Sorry, I thought we had until the end of the week.
                    I can offer to hold the meeting here at Microsoft if the wg prefers Seattle at that time.
                    Yes, the sun has been known to shine here in August : - )
                    Either location is OK with me btw.

                    There has been very little comment either way on this at the meeting or on the list.
                    The problem is that W3C rules require 6 weeks notice of meetings which I believe applies to time and location.
                    Assuming this is true, I think we have to go with the UC Irvine location unless we want to postpone the meeting....

                    Pesonally - If we are going to do "it" in Washington State, My vote is for Seattle rather than Redmond, unless we are are all camping at "Bill's new place on the lake" and you are making arrangements to have us shuttle in from SeaTac to the private Microsoft Airport.
                    Staging in Seattle saves the bulk of us the drive out to Redmond.
                    I myself would rather see us there staying at someplace like the Edgewater than in Redmond by far.
                    It's really easier to get to and has more night-life, etc etc etc.
                    A number of us have personal experience of the Edgewater's facilities from one of last year's ISC Meetings we had there.
                    Very good site and lots of reasoably priced facilities in the area and Pikes Market Arcade Area is a hop, skip, and a jump away.
                    Otherwise, by my vote - Sourthern California is fine by me.

                    I think Don's post just closed the issue.
                    It's in Irvine.

                    Pesonally - If we are going to do "it" in Washington State, My vote is for Seattle rather than Redmond, unless we are are all camping at "Bill's new place on the lake" and you are making arrangements to have us shuttle in from SeaTac to the private Microsoft Airport.
                    Staging in Seattle saves the bulk of us the drive out to Redmond.
                    I myself would rather see us there staying at someplace like the Edgewater than in Redmond by far.
                    It's really easier to get to and has more night-life, etc etc etc.
                    A number of us have personal experience of the Edgewater's facilities from one of last year's ISC Meetings we had there.
                    Very good site and lots of reasoably priced facilities in the area and Pikes Market Arcade Area is a hop, skip, and a jump away.
                    Otherwise, by my vote - Sourthern California is fine by me.

                    I propose to cancel this weeks telecon and schedule another for 12 Mar 2004, if needed.
                    I would like to get moving on comments on the TAG architecture document.
                    Jan - are you still up for reviewing?
                    Can we aim to get other comments in by the end of this week and agreement by email next week?

                    I think that means we will not formally respond to I18N on the charmod comments, shall I tell them that we do not intend to, but that the e-mail discussion has not shown any disagreement.
                    e.g. I have informed the RDF Core WG of your decisions, and no one has indicated unhappiness
                    - however we have not formally discussed these issues;
                    and are not likely to.

                    Is this a problem.
                    Have I understood correctly they are going through last call again anyway.
                    When is the deadline?
                    I'm prepared to decide by email so we can formally respond by email.

                    Im assuming that they are all cancelled unless I hear otherwise.
                    Maybe that should be our default?
                    I still plan to write a rather long diatribe on this if I can find the time.
                    I doubt if the rest of the WG will endorse all of it but I will send it along asap, hopefully some time next week.

                <content>Yes -
                    I could change my draft informal response to indicate that if we have any other formal response it will be included in our LC review comments on their new documents.
                    Two weeks from when I received the message ....
                    i.e. during Cannes
                    - I suspect that is also the real deadline, in that I imagine they want to make their final decisions at Cannes
                    I am happy to draft a formal response that is pretty vacuous, for e-mail vote.

                    That is a reasonable working assumption.
                    I've been announcing telecon's in advance and cancelling if not needed to keep within w3c process.

                    I've got an opportunity to do some fun family stuff this Friday, so I'd like to know whether it conflicts with an RDF Core telcon.
                    I haven't seen notice, and we're less than 7 days away, so I presume there's no WG telcon this week.
                    Sorry if I missed an announcement to that effect.
                    If the WG meets, I suppose it'll be somewhat unofficially.
                    In that case, I offer regrets.

                    Hmm,
                    I was just wondering that myself.
                    I see the following possible agenda items for a telecon:
                    a) wording changes to the semantics doc
                    b) advice to the CG about what to do about postponed issues
                    Dan, would you like the WG to meet to discuss/approve the proposed wording changes?
                    Will the 16th be soon enough?
                    Eric, is the CG seeking input from the WG about b).
                    WG, do folks want to meet to discuss a), b) or anything else?
                    I will send a formal notification of a telecon for 16th Jan, but will cancel if its not needed.
                    Dan, I hope you have fun on Friday.

                    Yes.
                    This issue was on last Monday's SW-CG agenda but time ran out before we were able to discuss this.
                    The need isn't urgent (e.g. no need to have a rdf-core call just for this issue) but should be addressed some time by the end of the month.

                    yes.
                    Good question, but I haven't done the relevant calendar research to figure it out.

                    Personally I prefer not to discuss postponed issues (for new recs?) until we've got this one in the bag.
                    As HP rep the position I represented was we did not need to resolve these issues in this standardization round.
                    For the next few weeks that remains the position I wish to represent.
                    When we get to rec, I have things that I individually think about the postponed issues and could contribute to a discussion.
                    Sorry for being so cautious.

                    I was not clear.
                    I was not proposing we discuss resolutions of the issues, but suggestions to the CG of how/whether these issues might, at some point in the future be resolved.
                    For example, the WG might recommend to the CG that some issues are higher priority than others.
                    Is that a discussion you feel able to contribute to?

                    I am not sure that we can have a procedural only discussion
                    - I guess if I am unconfortable I will just stay quiet
                    - and my silence should not be interpreted as assent.
                    For instance, I decided to not reply to Grahams msg on the postponed issues despite disagreeing with it.

                    It is probable that we can arrange a telephone connection, to call in via a US bridge.
                    Are there people who are unable to make the face to face meeting, but would like us to have this facility?
                    Please respond as soon as possible
                    - the decision will be made early next week.
                    cheers

                    - even at the end of a phone line (though in person would be better, of course!)

                    Please note the time zone difference, and if you intend to only be there for part of the time let us know which part of the time.
                    9am - 5pm Amsterdam time is 3am - 11am US Eastern time which is midnight to 8am pacific time.

                    It is probable that we can arrange a telephone connection, to call in via a US bridge.

                    Please respond as soon as possible
                    - the decision will be made early next week.

                    Since it will be Mountain time where I'll be, 9am - 5pm Amsterdam time is 1am - 9am, so I would participate the second half of the day.
                    Is there a good time to call in after Amsterdam lunch?

                    There have been a couple of possiblities raised:
                    Ottawa, 5 or 6 October (This depends on a number of other W3C timing issues)
                    Nashville, mid october
                    How do people feel about either of these?
                    Are we ready for a meeting, overdue for one, nowhere near it?
                    Are these good locations, or does someone have another proposal (offer of hosting...)

                    I think we should have something more concrete to meet about
                    - something that doesn't lend itself to list/telecon handling.
                    Plus it would be extremely helpful if more than one WG met around the same time/place.
                    Not necessarily in conjunction with some "external" event.

                    I think a face-to-face is a good idea and have no problems with either of the dates suggested.

                    The Nashville conference is the Educause conference from October 10-13.
                    All courseware developers will be attending.
                    Norman Coombs and I will be presenting on accessible courseware authoring.
                    Information about the event is at: http://www.educause.edu/conference/e2000
                    For the face to face meeting we had talked about having a working meeting.
                    We would have a set of tasks ie. Techniques for specific checkpoints, designing the conformance document, evaluating representative tools.
                    We would break out into small groups to create drafts and then gather as a whole group to review the drafts.

                    Don't know how long this meeting is going to take but with a joint meeting &amp;quot;long&amp;quot; seems more likely than &amp;quot;short&amp;quot;.
                    So just in case:
                    I have another (phone) meeting coming up at 3:30 Boston time (1 hour after this one) so if we haven't finished by then, I'll have leave early.
                    Tried to move it but that was just not possible.
                    Cheers,

                    Hi all,
                    Sorry about the delay, but this is the Techniques draft that I said I would do at the face-to-face.
                    It is not done but you will get the idea.
                    Language specific things have generally been removed (to be put in the separate docs).
                    Cheers,
                    Jan

                    Jan,
                    thanks for this
                    - it's a good piece of work.
                    How about we have the following categories:
                    + Things you need to do to meet the checkpoint (these can be fairly general)
                    + Techniques to do this (which should say how much of it they do)
                    + Things which are good to do although they go beyond the requirements of the checkpoint.
                    + References
                    These probably need to be sorted (where applicable) by tool type and priority.
                    For example to meet checkpoint 1.1 in a level-A tool, all that needs to be done is to provide source editing (and meet checkpoint 1.2 Preserve all accessibiltiy information, which can be done by not messing up the source).
                    But for a WYSIWYG tool this will not conform to 5.1 and 5.2, so the tool cannot get to double-A.
                    A source editing tool can use this technique to any level.
                    Cheers
                    Charles

                    I agree.
                    I'd really like to work on emphasizing cross-over situations in which doing one thing contributes to meeting several guidelines.
                    In the end this could be pulled out into a separate list of techniques that need to be implemented as opposed to checkpoints that need to be met.

                    Liddy has been admirably getting up at 2am on a regular basis to join our call.
                    I don't think we should continue to ask her to do that.
                    I would like to find an alternative time that works for everyone that regularly attends the teleconference.
                    This needs to take into account European time, Australian time and both east and west coast North American time.
                    How is everyone with 4:00pm EDT on Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday?
                    This would make it 6:00am in Australia and 9:00 pm in Europe.
                    Or does anyone have an alternative suggestion?

                    According to the International Meeting Planner, Jutta's suggestion of 4pm EST is pretty good
                    - although it is actually 10pm in Europe.
                    3pm EST would be 5am in Australia and 9pm in Europe.

                    - I do appreciate this gesture.
                    I believe 4.00pm on Tuesday would clash with the IMS meetings, if they continue at that time...

                    Hi Jutta,
                    The same issue arose a few weeks ago in the PF group.
                    It is very difficult to find a common time that works for every time zone.
                    10pm Central European Time means I can make some of the calls, but not all of them, but I understand the change.
                    regards,
                    carlos

                    I hesitate to speak for Heather, but in her absence, the time is do-able here in Pacific time;
                    however, at glancing at her schedule she may have conflicts with this time, at least on Mondays/Wednesdays
                    --Tuesdays look like a 30 minute conflict (at the last 1/2 hour).
                    I don't know if these are times that she can adjust or not.
                    She'll be back and able to speak for her own schedule next week.
                    When did you need to make a firm decision?
                    Thanks!

                    does it help to have different times?
                    I will be in Europe for a few weeks soon and so we could have meeting times that suit the meetings
                    - boring but maybe better for actual events?

                    I'm comfortable with whatever time is set and will remain flexible, even if it's 5:00am PDT.

                    Liddy has been admirably getting up at 2am on a regular basis to join our call.
                    I don't think we should continue to ask her to do that.
                    I would like to find an alternative time that works for everyone that regularly attends the teleconference.
                    This needs to take into account European time, Australian time and both east and west coast North American time.
                    How is everyone with 4:00pm EDT on Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday?
                    This would make it 6:00am in Australia and 9:00 pm in Europe.
                    Or does anyone have an alternative suggestion?

                    Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday at 4:00 pm EST would work for me but Tuesday or Wednesday would be better.
                    Fyi, I'm back but Lou Nell is going to sit in on the next call for me --
                    It's still Monday at 12:00 EST right?

                    We had discussed the possibility of a meeting together with the ATIA conference http://www.atia.org/conf_2004.html.
                    ATIA is quite firm that they do not want any meetings to overlap with their events if we plan it through them.
                    I already have an IMS meeting scheduled for Saturday afternoon and Sunday (January 17th and 18th).
                    Several people in ATAG are unavailable prior to the ATIA meetings.
                    This leaves two options, to plan our meetings in Orlando but not through ATIA or to hold the meetings on Monday the 19th and Tuesday the 20th.
                    Monday is Martin Luther King day.
                    What are your thoughts?
                    Can you suggest another venue and possible sponsor?
                    I am pursuing one other possibility but would like to hear back from the possible sponsor before I suggest it.
                    Thanks for your input.

                    I thought the IMS meeting was 16/17 ???
                    MLK Day is never better than in Savannah!
                    maybe we could go there?
                    I personally don't want to spend my life in Orlando, thank you!
                    I have to be in NY on the 23rd and then plan to go home.
                    I am not essential to this meeting, but there are my constraints.

                    I have never had a holiday in Venice, although I would like to.
                    But I can confirm that it is a nice place to have a meeting, and could probably attend (it is not that hard to get to from Europe).

                    If we can plan, what about planning the year, Australia included?
                    best time for us is anytime
                    - maybe northern winter from others' perspectives?

                    Planning meetings a year in advance (at least tentatively) is a good idea.
                    I will add this to the agenda for the next call.

                    Hello Education and Outreach Colleagues,
                    I was talking to a friend today -- an amateur web developer and professional disability rights advocate -- who complained that the W3C guidelines are overly technical for her needs.
                    She wants a plain language version of the guidelines.
                    As she is fairly technologically savvy, she expressed frustration at having to work so hard to understand what must be done to make accessible web pages.
                    To illustrate her point, she read me the Quick Tip card description of Image map.
                    I agree with her, the tone is definitely geeky.
                    But not everyone who develops web pages speaks the language of client-side servers and hotspots.
                    I would guess that most people who develop web pages are amateurs (in the original sense of the word: from amore or amour: an activity done out of love.)
                    Will these people freeze when they read &amp;quot;make line by line reading sensible?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Use CSS?&amp;quot;
                    How about we create a &amp;quot;user-friendly&amp;quot; version of the Web Content guidelines?
                    Maybe a primer.

                    you are not the first to ask about this...
                    this si a part of obtaining buy-in from the user community so implementation will go easier.
                    Remember my comments from toronto last year, &amp;quot;create a wcag for dummies&amp;quot; version....
                    hey, are there going to be EO, WAI and WCAG meetings at the www9?

                    What about the WCAG Curriculum?
                    Particularly the Example Set of the WCAG Curriculum?
                    Curriculum: http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/wcag/
                    Example set: http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/wcag/sam1-0.htm
                    Please note that the curriculum will be moving to W3C space in the next week or so.
                    Don't bookmark pages in the above site as they will soon be invalid.
                    Once the curriculum is in the W3C space, WAI EO will likely start promoting it more heavily.
                    Regards,

                    Welcome to the Web Accessibility Initiative Evaluation and Repair (WAI-ER-IG) Interest Group (not to be confused with the overall WAI Interest Group (WAI-IG).
                    As you know from the charter, http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ we'll be advising the ER Working group on tools for evaluating, repairing, and filtering web sites (some people will be members of both groups).
                    In addition to our own knowledge and experience, we'll rely on input from from novice and expert users with disabilities, web authors and administrators, ISP's, content owners, and vendors
                    --some of whom will be ourselves.
                    To start out, would you each say a few words about yourself and your involvement in this area?
                    I attached my own description below.
                    Len
                    Here's my own intro:
                    Hello.
                    I'm Len Kasday.
                    I had some opportunity to work on universal design while I was at AT&amp;amp;amp;T Bell Labs, e.g. designing the workstations at our Relay centers to accommodate communications assistants who are sighted, who use Braille, and who use a large screen and magnification.
                    I'm now at the Institute on Disabilities at Temple University in Philadelphia.
                    Also, I'm chair of this group.
                    (When you write about yourself please feel free to be a lot longer or shorter than I was.
                    Also, if your official job, i.e. your &amp;quot;day&amp;quot; job, isn't disability related, please mention it if you'd like to.
                    It can be very helpful to get a different perspective).

                    My name is Daniel Dardailler and I work for W3C, acting as overall WAI Project Manager and also chair of the Evaluation&amp;amp;amp;Repair working group (Len is chairing the Interest Group).
                    My involvement in Accessibility goes back to 1993 or so, when I started working on X Window Access.
                    I started at W3C in 1996 and helped starting and launching the WAI in 1997.
                    I think the work we're about to do in these two complementary ER groups is paramount to the success of the WAI.
                    Furthermore, I expect the ER IG to be instrumental in defining and refining the exact deliverables of the WG group.

                    Hi, I'm Al Gilman.
                    When I joined the dev-access list I said &amp;quot;I'm a standards reformer, and I have an agenda.&amp;quot;
                    Maybe that was a little in-your-face, and then maybe I am.
                    General background is at &amp;amp;lt;http://www.access.digex.net/~asgilman/&amp;amp;gt; .
                    I am wearing at least two hats in this particular context.
                    Under one hat I am chairing the WAI Protocols and Formats Working Group.
                    I think we need to have some empirical backup for protocol and format suggestions we make in the future.
                    So I am looking to this group to brainstorm some things to try, and the ER-WG to prototype some of them, so that we can be more confident of our recommendations.
                    Under another hat I am on the Trace Center team that will be supporting NSF NPACI webmasters with a toolkit strongly related to the results of the ER teams in the WAI.
                    This has led me to be talking with webmasters and web evaluators in the U.S. Federal Government, which is a business headquartered near where I live.
                    I have been talking up this group with those folks.

                    Chairman Kasday, Mr. Dardailler, and distinguished members of WAI Evaluation and Repair Interest Group list:
                    Allow me to introduce my self, Phill Jenkins, IBM Special Needs Systems, Austin, TX
                    I'm currently working on accessibility in general for IBM, including hardware, software, and especially Web and Java.
                    I've been accused of and called things, including::
                    2.Web site content owner - www.ibm.com/sns
                    3.Web site author, administrator, [and Web slave] - www.ibm.com/sns and other IBM sites
                    4.Tool vendors - IBM has many tools and applications including Screen Reader, Home Page Reader, I-checker, VisualAge, Fusion, Notes, Domino, etc.
                    5.trying to become an Expert on disabilities
                    6.was once an Expert on usability
                    - I actually did some original usability test for the PC back in the early 80's.
                    I witnessed test subjects removing [tearing off] the &amp;quot;protective cover&amp;quot; off the 5.25 inch floppy disks because of poor documentation and directions.
                    7.and I can reach out to obtain input from novice users, non-technical web site content owners, and any other people who might not normally participate directly.
                    Besides committing to a &amp;quot;minimum 3 hours per week&amp;quot;, remaining &amp;quot;current on w3c-wai-er-ig list and respond[ing] in timely manner to postings&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;participat[ing] in bi-weekly to monthly phone meetings or send[ing] regrets to chair&amp;quot;, I will continue to work on evaluating BOBBY, for both accessibility with our Java Screen Reader technology and use in evaluating our own IBM web sites.
                    I am also just now beginning to understand and learn Lotus Notes Domino - the twistie concern - and how it might be used to repair and/or filter site content to improve accessibility.
                    Yes, I read the charter...http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/
                    Regards,
                    Phill Jenkins

                    Hello everyone,
                    My name is Kitch Barnicle and I work part time at the American Foundation for the Blind in the technology access program.
                    When I am not at AFB I live the life of a graduate student.
                    At the moment I am in the process of collecting data for my doctoral dissertation, which is basically a usability study of how users of speech interact with GUI elements.
                    In general, I am interested in adapting usability testing techniques so that individuals with disabilities can be included in assessments of mainstream technology, including the web.
                    Prior to joining AFB in the fall of 1993, I was a manager of evaluations at the federally funded rehabilitation engineering center on the evaluation of assistive technology.
                    Though our evaluations primarily focused on mobility related devices such as wheelchairs, scooters and bathroom equipment, I think the experience will prove useful to me in this endeavor.
                    I'm looking forward to working with the group.
                    Kitch

                    Just a reminder:
                    we are holding a conference call today in spite of the fact that it is a holiday (Thanksgiving) in the US.
                    I don't know if any of our editors will be on the call, so I suggest we use the time to discuss Wendy's draft charter.
                    It can be found at: http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/new-charter-2000.html
                    Attendance at today's meeting is optional for our American colleagues.
                    If you have to choose between turkey and talking, I will understand if you opt for the food.

                    by the way, does anyone have any comments or suggestions on the Case Study we submitted on how to make Macromedia accessible?
                    Would like to modify the 50 State Quarter Interactive Map at www1.usmint.gov.
                    We are also making more of these for other products and one is in development now.

                    aloha!
                    in addition to including the phone number and time of the call in meeting announcements, could you please email the reminders the day _BEFORE_ the meeting, as it does me little good if i receive a reminder for a meeting shortly before the meeting begins, especially if that is a day where i could spare an hour or so for a telecon, but don't want to get sucked into answering all of my accumulated email!

                    I beleive WAI and assume W3C policy is that meeting announcements, including an agenda should be posted to the list at least 24 hours prior to a telecon meeting.
                    I have tried to adhere to this policy in the UA working group and I think it has help keep people interested in the participating in the telecons.

            <Text>
                <content>
                    Question: Does a requirement to use graphics "when appropriate" -- something that may not be easily done by users with visual disabilities -- mean that blind people are not going to be "good" web designers?
                    Especially if we are going to expect them to be skilled in graphical user interface design and understand how to use images to communicate with people with cognitive disabilities?
                    If we adopted a "use graphics" requirement as a P1, would a blind designer be able to meet that requirement effectively?
                    Just thinking out loud

                    Some would, some wouldn't.
                    Same as sighted people.
                    For example, some of my blind friends are much more visually capable than I am, and some aren't.
                    An analgous question might be to ask whether a blind person is going to be able to adequately describe an image - currently a P1 requirement in a number of situations.

                    It's not the same, because a blind person can simply choose to -not- use an image if they feel they can't reasonably describe it...under the current guidelines.
                    (This changes when images become a -requirement for accessibility-.)
                    You do bring up a good point, however, that many people who can see are also not "visually capable" and may not be able to provide graphics easily.
                    I'm not sure if -I- can provide decent graphics for my sites
                    -- and I refuse to believe that I need to give up web design because people with CDs (supposedly) need graphics...

                    There are lots of cases where a blind designer could use graphics as effectively, or actually more effectively, than a sighted person.
                    These are cases where the graphics are selected or generated in a rule based or standardized way.
                    For example, there are packages that generate flow charts from a textual description of a process.
                    These insure a sensible flow chart...
                    at least a chart that "parses" correctly.
                    On the other hand, I've seen too many flow chart style diagrams by sighted people where I have trouble understanding what conventions if any they're using.
                    I'll take a rule based design by a blind indivdiual any day.
                    Other examples are graphs generated from data, schematic diagrams generated from pspice lists, and icons selected from a standardized set.
                    Also, page layout and color selection can be made according to rules and standards.
                    Now, what about more creatively artistic uses of design, uses that can't be reduced to mathematical or verbal rules?
                    Well, first of all that goes beyond our guidelines:
                    we're just looking at usability and I think rule-based graphics should handle that.
                    Second of all, I think there are certainly some blind individuals who can produce better art than some sighted individuals (better than me for example), certainly among people who have some vision and early visual experience.
                    As for art by people born blind... I'm not familiar with that area but I woudn't be surprised there's some remarkable use of shape and form.

                    Jonathan, do you really mean to be insulting to me?
                    We may be having a comprehension problem, but if you're going to react in a way that seems to question my "loyalty to cause" -- despite being willing to take the time needed to work through this issue, as my repeated email messages haven proven that I'm willing to do -- then you're likely to turn away even MORE people who could be your strongest allies.
                    Perhaps this is just a communication error
                    -- your "style" of writing is vastly different from mine, and I certainly see how confusion could result.

                    We are moving forward with holding a face2face meeting in Bristol, England 5 and 6 October.
                    It has been proposed that the Authoring Tool Working Group join us to discuss the revision of WCAG on the afternoon of the 6th.
                    How do people feel about this opportunity to discuss the current state of the draft with another working group?
                    Do you feel we will need the full two days to work on the draft?
                    Thanks,

                    WL: I believe that it is mandatory to discuss states of the draft as they are reached to help avoid possible oversights and conflicts.
                    I believe that it will take far more than the two full days to work on the draft and that a meeting involving AU will constitute &amp;quot;working on the draft.&amp;quot;
                    I may be the only one who's on five (count 'em 5) Working Groups and even though there is some personnel overlap, the groups do &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; different.
                    It (Bristol) is something to look forward to and prepare for.
                    I hope it works out because the WAI's influence on the overall W3C and the strength-through-diversity we're achieving is a great model for just about everything and it's starting to bear fruit.

                    We are moving forward with holding a face2face meeting in Bristol, England 5 and 6 October.
                    It has been proposed that the Authoring Tool Working Group join us to discuss the revision of WCAG on the afternoon of the 6th.
                    How do people feel about this opportunity to discuss the current state of the draft with another working group?
                    Do you feel we will need the full two days to work on the draft?
                    Thanks,

                    Thanks Wendy for this really positive response.
                    I do hope I have not gone overboard with enthusiasm, and realise that you may all have a few other matters arising.
                    I can gassbag on for ever, but would you all (ok most or even some) like to see some commercial graphics/multimedia software designed to be used by Learning Difficulties clients for authoring.
                    I have 2 packages in mind, together with a variety of printed documents, from a number of different sources.
                    Also, why Bristol, London is a good bit more convenient for me, and a LD client?
                    I might also be able to organise a visit to a LD day centre for interested parties.

                    I am not sure this will hold but
                    As a general rule....
                    I think we should try to design guidelines that do not forbid anything - but
                    rather tell people how to do things so that they will be accessible.
                    When the next version comes out next week - we should look through it to see

                    This isn't forbidding anything -- but it's making it clear that there

                    I think even WCAG 1.0 can be regarded as consistent with this method of
                    specifying guidelines, in that the word &amp;quot;avoid&amp;quot; was deliberately chosen to
                    imply the existence of alternative, more accessible, means of achieving
                    the same objective. WCAG 2.0 should, however, make this point clearer, to
                    avoid (pun intended) giving the impression that there are prohibitions in
                    the guidelines that would limit the capacity of content creators to design
                    web sites that fulfill their respective purposes.

                    Gregg,
                    You make an excellent point!
                    As soon as you &amp;quot;forbid&amp;quot; something, you find out that some disabled group
                    at an opposite end of some spectrum &amp;quot;needs&amp;quot; what you've forbidden ... we
                    need to explain the consequences, and let the author decide what is most
                    appropriate for his/her site.
                    Anne

                    Excellent point -- the body of knowledge for disability access
                    considerations, beyond those of blind people (which are generally
                    well-explored these days), is pretty skimpy. We're -still- in the
                    exploration/discovery process of &amp;quot;what works&amp;quot;, and as we see more
                    solutions like Reef's -- which allow you to build an interface for
                    ONE audience without fearing interference with OTHER audiences'
                    interfaces -- we will encounter more and more solutions which will
                    &amp;quot;work&amp;quot; for some people and &amp;quot;not work&amp;quot; for others.
                    Forbidding them outright will cause a lot of problems, in the same
                    way that alternate interfaces stated &amp;quot;as a last resort&amp;quot; cause problems
                    when usable, accessible design is your &amp;quot;first resort&amp;quot;!
                    Absolutes should be avoided, always.

                    I have noticed that when using a screen reading browser such as IBM homepage reader when words are joined together for example &amp;quot;homepage&amp;quot; the words &amp;quot;home&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;page&amp;quot; are not recognised, as a consequence the joined words become incomprehensible to the screenreading software.
                    I haven't found any references to this within the gudielines.

                    14.1 Use the clearest and simplest language appropriate... [priority 1]
                    Of course at some point speech technology needs to learn how to deal with common but new terms in a language.
                    Homepage is one that I would expect to work - especially in a product whose name includes the term.
                    But Text to Speech is an inexact science - even people who are experts cannot agree to pronounce words the same way.
                    Just ask a well-trained and very literate American chemist what the eleme whose symbol is Al is called - they tell you about a thing called &amp;quot;aluminum&amp;quot;.
                    But they are in fact referring to what any Australian voice recogniser would expect to hear as al-(y)a-min-(i)-yum.
                    The problem is funnier (after people get over the inconvenience of learning about it) when a screen reader uses a finnish or swedish synthesiser but provides its cues and prompts in english...

                    No, it's not obvious at all.
                    Yes, when in doubt, hypenate compounds if you have any doubt as to how long they have been in the language.
                    Some screen readers will successfully divide camelCase agglutinations.
                    I don't know how widespread this is, though.
                    You would have to have the memory of an elephant to pull up the following flames.
                    But they do touch on text-to-speech, along with lay persons, people operating in a second language, and others with reading difficulty as at risk on account of unusual words including neologisms:
                    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2000Dec/0079.html
                    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2001JulSep/0542.html
                    The point is to have and apply a reasonably small word list and handle those things that fall outside this list as special.
                    My spell-checker in Eudora 4 bounces 'homepage' and suggests &amp;quot;home page&amp;quot; as a possible correction.
                    Need we say more?
                    It could be as simple as &amp;lt;acronym title=&amp;quot;home page&amp;quot;&amp;gt; homepage &amp;lt;/acronym&amp;gt; although purists will yell at me.

                    There is probably a good argument for raising the issue of proper names.
                    In my brief experience it seems that common dictionary words are read well enough.
                    However it seems that people and place names are not.
                    These are the very words that are of greatest interest.
                    it would also be great to see a decent ua that offered alternative readings (as per spell checker example), a memorise function, and possibly the opportunity to share the choice with a public database.
                    Perhaps somone knows of this?

                    It would appear that this is readily available using Speech synthesis markup language and XSLT (or XSLT 2 perhaps)...
                    or someone can make smarter and smarter speech synthessisers.
                    If Audio CSS allowed something equivalent to SSML's say-as propoerty, we would be closer perhaps.

                    Sorry, you are missing the main brunt of Jonathan's remarks.
                    Yes, SSML, modularized, provides the WCAG piece.
                    But who/how accesses the dictionary?
                    One of the creative things he raises is uploading your pronunciation repairs to the community.
                    What Annotea would like to do.
                    But personal data is in LDAP today, not RDF.
                    So we need LDAP bindings for the SSML.
                    To make the web whole.

                    Quick question.
                    In earlier versions of Acrobat, it was not possible to make PDF files accessible if the files were actually developed on a Macintosh.
                    Is this still the case with the latest version of Acrobat for the Mac (version 6.0, I believe)?
                    Thanks for any information.

                    it is available in both Acrobat 6.0 Professional and Acrobat 6.0 Standard, for the Mac and Windows.

                    Hello Loretta/Doyle,
                    I am just not sure what the Make Accessible feature really does.
                    I am a JAWS user and a PDF file is as usable or unusable as it was before I run the Make Accessible feature on it.
                    I'll be glad if you can enlighten me on this.

                    Sailesh,
                    Make Accessible is a command that attempts to analyze an untagged PDF file and infer logical structure from the marks on the page.
                    This would be used by an author who is trying to repair accessibility problems in an existing PDF file.
                    The best analogy is that it is doing OCR on the logical strucure.
                    Like OCR technology, it is imperfect, and the results should be reviewed and corrected, if necessary, by the author.
                    In Acrobat 5, this command was only available on Windows.
                    In Acrobat 6, it is available for both Mac and Windows.
                    When the Adobe Reader 6.0 is presenting an untagged PDF file to assistive technology, it automatically runs MakeAccessible internally to infer logical structure.
                    This can make loading an untagged PDF considerably slower than loading a tagged PDF, but makes it possible, for example, to read tables even in an untagged PDF.

                    I need to help assemble and populate a small computer lab to examine web usability issues.
                    This is a very large ballpark and I need to narrow the options we're going to explore.
                    I'm seeking your opinion about what tools we should test with.
                    We have to start someplace and picking a specific set of tools seems to be a reasonable place.
                    I gather that there's no such thing as a perfect list but I need to put one together anyway.
                    I'd like to hear about your opinions and preferences about tools if you care to share them.
                    I suspect a public forum is not the best place to share these sentiments.

                    I'd use Netscape 3.x and 4.x, a version of MS Internet Explorer (as you can't have two versions on the same machine to my knowledge), a text browser such as lynx., PwWebSpeak for the voice browser and maybe Opera if you have extra time and money.
                    Also to be considered is the use of a general screen reader such as Jaws For Windows.
                    Use of tools such as bobby and HTML validators is also essential.
                    It might be sensible to have disabled users actually do the testing.

                    I'm replying publicly because this is an important issue which is facing a lot of people, not just you.
                    (You are just the 1% prepared to put their hand up and ask...)
                    I would skip IE/Netscape, since designers worth 2c can tell you already how things work there by reading the code.
                    The first thing I would do is validate the HTML and check with Bobby, but read the results and think about it rather than simply believing what you're told.
                    For browsers I would look at Lynx, a screen reader (eg winvision, or jaws) and a proper audio browser like pwWebSpeak.
                    If you can, use WebTV and a Macintosh version of things
                    - this will generally show up the problems much faster.
                    The key is to learn where the problems arise so you can cut back the test/repair cycle.
                    It is a great efficiency if you can solve the problems by design rather than by repair.

                    By the way, if you weren't aware, there's an emulator for WebTV that runs on Windows 95/* and Macintosh that you can download from developer.webtv.net.
                    I recommend it to my accessibility class students, since the more browsers you expose someone to, the quicker they realize that the web is designed to support ANY valid user agent, not just "the big two".

                    I recently discovered that ABC Radio National here in Australia (http://www.abc.net.au/rn/) offers transcripts of certain of its programmes via the web.
                    I haven't checked the accessibility of the site, and, as I understand it, the transcripts appear several days after the programmes themselves have been broadcast.
                    Are other radio stations with a presence on the web adopting similar policies?

                    more interestingly check out http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS
                    As far as I can tell, it's not linked into their main page yet.
                    Note that the page is extremely table rich (a euphasism of sorts)
                    --but emacspeak/w3 should give you good access.

                    The central point here is that providing transcripts of audio content is a requirement under the guidelines, so that if an audio stream is provided, transcripts must also be made available.

                    We have three links listed on the AWARE Center site, on the &amp;quot;tips&amp;quot; page:
                    http://aware.hwg.org/tips/
                    But I would love to have more.
                    Diane Wilson's site (linked from the page above) is a nice start:

                    I've heard that if you create a page with alt tags and bring it into word to edit it and then export it back to html that the alts are stripped?
                    can anyone confirm or deny this?
                    Thanks!

                    I'm guessing you mean the ALT= attribute on the &amp;lt;IMG&amp;gt; tag?
                    (There's no &amp;lt;/IMG&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ALT&amp;gt; tag.)
                    That's about what I'd expect to happen, with Word or any other wordprocessor.
                    I could test this on my system if you can confirm the scenario:
                    - Start with an HTML document, created by any means.
                    - The doc contains an &amp;lt;/ALT&amp;gt;&amp;lt;IMG&amp;gt; with the ALT= attribute.
                    - The HTML doc is opened in Word and some text on the page is changed or added.
                    - The page is &amp;quot;Saved as HTML&amp;quot; from Word, without first saving it in Word format.
                    PS: *Why* would you use Word to edit an HTML document?!
                    &amp;lt;/IMG&amp;gt;

                    Many people required to edit and create web pages and/or sites are not web professionals and the only "WYSIWYG" tool available to them is Word.
                    I daresay that most people don't know HTML and are not going to learn it so that they can make an accessible page through a text editor.
                    This is especially true if the only editing required of them is small such as changing the grammar on a web page or correcting spelling of a word.
                    This is exactly why the authoring tools aspect of the WAI is so important.

                    MS-Word has elegant text-editing commands that are absent from a basic text editor, and that make editing documents a pleasure.
                    For example, you can quickly move entire lines or paragraphs without using the clipboard;
                    select words, sentences, and paragraphs by pressing a single key;
                    and undo and redo 100 levels.
                    All of the above can be done using keyboard and point-and-click techniques.
                    So there is a lot of versatility.
                    Unfortunately, many of the really powerful Word commands are extremely poorly documented.
                    Furthermore, savvy Word users can create special-purpose editing commands in Visual Basic to enhance the usefulness of the word processor as a text editor.
                    Why use Word?
                    Because it is a good tool for the job.

                    BTW, Hot Metal Pro, a web editor tool that does pretty good on accessibility and valid HTML, has the ability to import Word files.
                    My wife uses that regularly to convert City of Fullerton documents from Word to HTML, rather than cutting-and-pasting and marking up herself or trusting 'Save as HTML...'

                    I could *not* re-create the problem described when I tested this on my own system using MS Word 97 for Windows.
                    I followed the scenario with a simple test page (created in Netscape Page Composer) with a Heading, one line of text, and an image with ALT= text.
                    I opened the HTML file in Word97, added one word to the text of the Heading, then saved the file back to HTML with a new name.
                    The ALT= text was not affected.
                    MS Word 97, at least, seems to recognize HTML and preserve it.
                    Obviously, other versions of Word may behave differently.
                    I suspect that *any* word processor would strip the ALT= text if you first save the document in its *native* format, then try to save it back to HTML.

                    I tried that with Word 97 and there was no lost of ALT.
                    I even tried saving the file as .doc format, copying it under a different name.doc, reopening it in Word and saving it in HTML, and the ALT were still present (which proves that the ALT are somehow stored in the doc format)
                    On the other hand, there was a lost of longdesc, link, and others new HTML4 table attributes;
                    in fact, in looks like unknown attributes are pruned out, which shouldn't happen (unknown elements are kept, albeit mess up with, see below)
                    The DOCTYPE and the STYLE I had in this test file were moved from the top and the head to the body, which is really bad.
                    Anyway, join the WAI Authoring Tools working group if you're interested in that kind of issue.
                    Because you use Windows ? (I use Unix)

                    First define disability.
                    Someone can be disAbled by a congenital defect, chronic illnesses or injury.
                    It could be any combination of, or even multiple, congenital defects, illnesses and/or injuries.
                    There are also debilitating side effects of medications.
                    A &amp;quot;non-reader&amp;quot; is not necessarily blind
                    - they may have had a TBI (traumatic brain injury) or have a Learning Disability.
                    Disabilities can effect fine and gross motor skills.
                    (Arthritis is a common fine motor complaint)
                    A Quadriplegic may use different assistive technologies, such as voice pilots, mouth tools or devices that follow eye movement.
                    Some people type with their toes!
                    IMO, before you can define Accessibility you must first define disability.

                    Why?
                    I view that anyone should be able to access information, regardless of whether or not they have a &amp;quot;disability.&amp;quot;
                    Your access shouldn't be _limited_ because you have a certain quality about you that other people don't have.
                    Regardless if we call that a &amp;quot;disability&amp;quot; or not, it should not interfere with your ability to access content on the Internet.
                    I think it's perfectly reasonable to define &amp;quot;accessibility&amp;quot; with having a strict definition of &amp;quot;disability&amp;quot; as long as your accessibility definition doesn't speak _only_ about access for people who fit that disability definition.

                    OK.
                    Here's my short definition:
                    &amp;quot;Disability is a design flaw in the environment.&amp;quot;
                    Here's the long version, from a chapter in an upcoming book on web-based training:
                    &amp;quot;People are not &amp;quot;disabled.&amp;quot;
                    A disability is a consequence of design flaws in the environment.
                    Some individuals, due to accident, illness, or heredity, have difficulties performing -- or cannot perform -- certain tasks, such as moving their legs, seeing, hearing, talking, grasping or lifting.
                    When these functional limitations are severe enough to adversely affect a person's performance, and the natural and human environments fail to accommodate their functional limitations, the individual is said to have a disability.&amp;quot;
                    You take your pick.
                    If I were rewriting it, I would say something like this:
                    ... ALL individuals, due to circumstance, accident, illness, or heredity, have difficulties performing -- or cannot perform -- certain tasks...

                    I like to tell people that if a blind person can't access the web page she's trying to use, the REASON is not _her_ disability, but the disability of the _web author_ who created the page.
                    That web author is &amp;quot;disabled&amp;quot; because he was _not able_ to make a correct web page.
                    Why should she suffer for _his_ problem or failing?
                    In no way is a user with a disability &amp;quot;disabled&amp;quot; on the web
                    -- the sites THEMSELVES have the disability inherent in their code by not being accessible!
                    We should identify the problem where it exists.
                    The problem is not that there's anything &amp;quot;wrong with&amp;quot; the user, it is a problem with the page author and his output!

                    I should like to add that we do have to accept that the victorians probably had an insuperable task in trying to design and build a wheelchair for a quadraplegic that the individual could control themselves.
                    Today this is possible if not universal.

                    He thinks he's found &amp;quot;an issue&amp;quot; and has latched onto it in order to &amp;quot;save us from government,&amp;quot; but really he's just a kook.

                    The Freedom Forum's fear mongering aside, does anyone know what's up with the release of all the 508 accessibility regulations?
                    Why did the feds take such a closed-door approach when it was commonly expected that the info would be available on Feb. 7?

                    Ya got me.
                    I don't see it as a closed-door approach, though, the way I read their announcement.
                    http://www.access-board.gov/508Update.htm
                    Maybe I'm just too trusting of gummit workers, but this seems more like typical bureaucracy slowness than any sort of concerted conspiracy to derive us of our rights. :)
                    I suppose that Mr. Yanchulis would be the one to ask, though:
                    For further information contact:

                    I think you are correct about the bureaucracy part.
                    However, being thorough can take time, if it's anything like our listserve. :)
                    The linked announcement mentions that &amp;quot;..the standards will be published in the Federal Register and be made available for public comment&amp;quot;, so it sounds like it will eventually be opened up.

                    Yes, a little Civics 101 is in order.
                    The Federal Register _is_ the institution created expressly to make _sure_ citizens have the chance to comment on things before they are imposed.
                    For more information, please consult Federal Register

                    kelly,
                    That is a good question and should be asked of our next guest, Doug Wakefield on our march 16 web cast at abletv.net.
                    I would add that any other questions you might want to ask doug, should be done on that evening.
                    please check out the exact time for when the webcast will happen under the press release link at abletv.net.

                    Actually, the government is not robbing us of our rights, but protecting us.
                    i know this sounds paradoxical, but it is true.
                    For any NOI (notice of inquiry), NPRM (notice of proposed rule making), etc. the government must follow the procedures established in the apa (i believe it is known as the Americans procedural Act) of 1947, which outlines the procedures of putting the NOI and NPRM out for comment for a specific time period.
                    The problem is that when they do this and get a large response to a particular NPRM, they (the government) is obligated to read each and every one of the responses, corrolate them and summarize them into specific response categories, if possible.
                    They do this with a limited staff.
                    This is not to say that i don't get frustrated either, but just an expalnation of the process.

                <content>
                    Hi,
                    So far, about 24 screen reader users have sent in votes.
                    One person didn't like the screen reader version because of the long links.
                    What he didn't realize was that the links were the same for both versions.
                    He just hadn't run into them in the standard version before trying the version for screen reader users.
                    Two other users forgot to make a choice.
                    The remaining 21 users preferred the version formatted for screen readers over the standard version.
                    A couple of people commented that they would want some more text on the screen reader version.
                    Scott

                    All I get are the &amp;quot;notify&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;beta tester&amp;quot; links, which lead to forms to fill in the needed information.
                    (These work as they should.)
                    No word on what the site will actually do.
                    Sounds like a lot of E-hype to me.

                    I don't get any unusual code (other than the CFM declaration at the top).
                    Otherwise it looks pretty normal, &amp;amp;amp; reads just fine with JFW3.5.
                    A few small problems such as ALT text &amp;quot;pages\cleardot1.gif&amp;quot; (approx.), but nothing really unusual.
                    Unless there is some CFM-generated applet thing happening that I'm missing completely.

                    Jonathan,
                    Thank you for the url.
                    I scanned through this fascinating site this morning and will forward this information to the ADA compliance officer who works with this project.
                    Thanks, too, for asking about the effect of the animated gifs on people with epilepsy.
                    This is the first time that I have ever seen such a question.
                    I have a epilepsy from being electrocuted.
                    I did not have difficulty with these animations.
                    What triggers my seizures is color mixtures, especially any combination of red/blue/yellow, and the movements need to be fast like with a turning signal on a car ahead of me in a turning lane, an emergency vehicle, flashing advertising boards, and the like.
                    Your gifs are slow, are black and white mostly, and are simple movements, not swaying or twirling.
                    Again, good work!
                    I was doing my dissertation in the area of online instructional design and cognition.
                    After my accident I had to change that.
                    I'm pleased to see that someone is actually doing something to make reading and communication more possible in this text-heavy learning environment.
                    Sincerely,

                    WL: I wish I could understand the notion of making reading more possible within an environment that wasn't "text-heavy".
                    Perhaps it would be "nice" for people for whom text is a problem but just how is it "possible".
                    In at least the commonest definition of the word "read", the matter that one reads is "text".
                    I understand the part about "communication" not requiring a "text-heavy" environment, but not "reading".

                    This isn't necessarily the case, William.
                    There is a lot of reading that is non-textual.
                    I _highly_ recommend, to everyone on this list, the book "Understanding Comics" by Scott McCloud.
                    It deals with the (U.S.) comic book medium and has some interesting thoughts and concepts on the "language of comics" as a blend between graphical and text media.
                    In fact, I have it on the shelf behind me at work as I type this, beside my XHTML, XSLT, CSS, usability, and disability references.

                    - I was wondering if you would explain your work in this area.
                    I am currently doing an MSc in Computer Studies and my project is looking at web accessibility for people with learning disabilities.
                    I'd appreciate any useful ideas/references that you or anyone else reading this may have.
                    Thanks!

                    I have built a form which has a submit button on it.
                    If the user activates the button and hasn't filled out the form correctly, a javascript 'alert' pop-up is presented to the user, giving more information.
                    This appears to be in breach of checkpoint 10.1
                    http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/wai-pageauth.html#tech-avoid-pop-ups
                    Would it be acceptable to provide a warning message, something like 'Submitting this form may result in a pop-up dialog being displayed' before the submit button, in the same color as the background?
                    Thus (I believe) making the text available to screen reader users but not to sighted users?
                    Regards

                    This will show up on any device that cannot display colours or doesn't understand the styling used to set the colours.
                    It is a known trick for stuffing keywords for search engines and may result in the site being boycotted by major search engines.
                    One is expecting a major change in content when one submits a form, so one of the main reasons for avoiding popups doesn't apply.

                    It also depends on how the screen reader gets its content -
                    readers that are too smart about colours (a useful feature) will realise that the text is invisible and skip it.
                    (given the way this is normally used to stuff keywords in pages, it is not a bad practice).

                    Hi All,
                    You could try using a spacer image and then put your message in the alt text.
                    I don't know how that will behave in the screenreader but it may help get around the problem with the search engine.

                    Perhaps not, since putting spider-bait in alt attributes is just as old a search-engine as hiding stuff using colour.
                    On the other hand there isn't really anyway I can think of for spiders to know whether they are being baited unless there is a lot of repetition of words other than &amp;quot;a&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;the&amp;quot;, etc.
                    Spider-baiting in itself is quite a problem for users of text, whether sighted text-only users or users of enabling technologies.
                    I've quite often come across sites with little for a text-only user to read but the keywords they want to be listed over repeated 50 times.

                    I would doubt that these organizations, owned by their members, are covered by 508.

                    Federal Credit Unions are not federal agencies, they are owned by the members that form them.
                    They are regulated, however.
                    See http://www.cuna.org/data/consumer/whatis/whatisacu.html and (when it's up) http://www.ncua.gov/
                    As far as I can see, a credit union doesn't fall under 508.

                    But they DO fall under ADA and that does require &amp;quot;equivalent facilitation&amp;quot; which could require usable web site and Section 508 serves as guidance

                    Peepo has advocated for some years the use of the keyboard as means to select links.
                    In the latest mozilla browser, when you type a letter, except in a text entry box, it cycles through links that have that letter in their text.
                    it seems slightly buggy, but what do you think?
                    (course it screws my coding right and proper)

                    i found out about this only a few days ago and have been using the so-called 'typeaheadfind' since then quite a lot.
                    i haven't found it buggy at all and absolutely love it.
                    it's more a Find function then a 'cycling through links' function.
                    with the focus on the page you just type a word (or beginning of it) and mozilla jumps to that word.
                    F3 finds the next instance.
                    it first only looks at links but if you type a '/' (slash) before the word it searches the whole text.
                    it really just saves you bringing up that cumbersome Find dialogue box.
                    i don't think it really works for cycling through links.
                    the tab key works better for that.

                    Indeed....
                    I have loved Opera's &amp;quot;inline find&amp;quot; for a long time.
                    Sounds like Moz has copped another Opera feature ;-)
                    http://tntluoma.com/opera/lover/day13-inlinefind/
                    I still haven't found anything that matches Opera's CONTROL+J (which will list all links on the page).
                    It also gives you a quick method to see if your links will make sense when read out of context.

                    well those are some of the positives, how about disabling for those who are hyperactive, and just cannot stop fiddling with the keyboard?
                    its buggy in the sense that for instance 'k' words aren't just those that start with the letter k but also those that include the letter k.
                    I'd expect it to have a few others besides.

                    I am planning my schedule at CHI 2003 &lt;http://www.chi2003.org/&gt;
                    - will there be anything happening at the conference related to this W3C User interest group?
                    I do not see anything on the program yet, but I suspect we could at least have an informal SIG
                    - a chance to meet others and bring someone like me (who missed the workshop) up to speed on what is happening.
                    Like all CHIs, there will be many competing activities, so the sooner we can set this up the more likely I can attend.

                    I will be at CHI.
                    I sent an email to Steven Pemberton about getting an update on his draft of the charter and its status at W3C.
                    I really would like to get some updated info. before planning an informal SIG.
                    However, if you email me that you are interested in meeting at CHI, I can try to arrange something--
                    either signing up for an informal sig or arranging to meet for lunch or something.

                    It's been quite a while since I've seen any traffic on this list serv.
                    I had to check with Matt May to make sure things were still in synch on the working group.
                    Let's not lose our zeal folks!

                    I think we decided at the NIST meetings to have our next meeting at CHI, and I have been planning on such a meeting there.
                    Did this plan change?

                    I have been in contact with Steven Pemberton.
                    Here is the plan for CHI:
                    I will sign up for an informal SIG at CHI.
                    I haven't found out the time slots yet, but will try to today.
                    For those of you who want to attend the sig, let me know if you have any hard constraints and I will try to sign up for a time to accommodate as many people as possible.
                    Steven and I will also meet at CHI for planning purposes.

                    The most convenient time to schedule the W3C UIG informal sig discussion is: Tuesday 4/8 1-2:30pm
                    This is the lunchtime slot.
                    I don't think we will need the entire 90 minutes so there will be time for lunch afterwards.
                    As of Friday, this slot was still open for an informal SIG.
                    If this is not available or there are conflicts, Wednesday 4/9 1-2:30 will be the backup.
                    I will email the informal SIG people and get on the schedule this afternoon and confirm via this listserv.
                    Hope to see you next week.

                    Peter, or other folks
                    Is there anyone from the OpenOffice or StarOffice projects who has time to represent the group on the W3C Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines working group, or to give us updates and feedback on how much those guidelines are implemented by the project?
                    The Guidelines are designed to apply to all tools used to produce content for the Web
                    - both "HTML editors" and the range of other tools that people use to produce content, such as office productivity tools and media editing tools.
                    More information at http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU and guidelines (W3C Recommendation since Feb 2000) at http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG10
                    cheers

                    We did hold a short meeting with Phil and Heather on the call.
                    The Summit was discussed.
                    Heather will not be able to make it due to wedding plans, IBM will be there.
                    Everyone thought it was a good opportunity to pull together the various efforts.

                    Dear ALL,
                    I have now completed an update to the paper &amp;quot;A Dyslexic Perspective on e-Content Accessibility&amp;quot;.

                    Peter,
                    to clear up a possible confusion, can you confirm that you're use of SLD refers to specific learning difficulty or dyslexia, and not Severe Learning Difficulties or cognitive disability?
                    looks to be a great resource, we now link to it and http://www.techdis.ac.uk/seven/disability_and_the_web.html from http://www.learningdifferently.com/develop/papers.html where there are links to many other useful resources on LDD and the web

                    hi,
                    The paper cover Dyslexia and Dyslexic-like specific learning difficulties.
                    But it does it does not specifically cover the &amp;quot;learning disabled&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Severe Learning Difficulties&amp;quot; or Cognitive disabilities.
                    My remit is for those who could be potentially studying at a minimum of a Further Educational level.
                    You might find that the paper covers many of the issues but it completely side-steps the issues when a student has a savere language difficulty or savere cognition problem...
                    I would need to go into talking about the appropriateness of content, symbolic communications. etc etc.
                    I do hope within the future to write a similar paper about web accessibility for those with hearing impairment (including pre-lingually deaf).

                    Hi
                    I am just wondering if many users, disabilities or not, find white text on black background much easier to read than black on white.
                    If it is the case I will include both in the style switcher I am making.
                    Best regards,

                    Jesper,
                    It is my experience that many visually impaired users who still retain some eyesight prefer light text on dark backgrounds, especially when on a monitor screen.
                    This is due in part to the fact that the &amp;quot;glare&amp;quot; from a white monitor screen is hard on the eyes, and can often wash out thin black lines (like text).
                    I personally know of at least 2 partially sighted users who have set up their machines with dark backgrounds and light text, even to the point of one setting their web browser to over-ride developers colours.

                    I am aware that some people also swop between different settings, ie they may choose to work with black text on a white background in the morning, then as their eyes tire they might change their preferences to white text on a black background.
                    Also, when implementing the style switcher it is important not to prevent people from using their own style sheet or browser preferences.
                    I have seen some switchers that do this and if the choices offered do not suit someone's needs it can be quite limiting.
                    Cheers,
                    Sandra.

                    Hi Jesper
                    Will you be including any other colour schemes?
                    Black on gold and black on certain shades of blue can improve readability for some dyslexics.*

                    My understanding is that the original reason for using white (or green or orange) on black was that flicker is more obvious on large areas of solid white.
                    Viewing GUIs on CRTs, I get the impression that some rasterisers on some fonts don't handle white on black well (you need to handle them differently because a white pixel is larger than a black pixel, to ensure that adjacent white pixels overlap, when using a write white device, like a typical CRT.

                    BlankIt a appears another interesting case goes to court today where a wheel chair user is seeking compensation from London Stanstead Airport and Ryan Air for charging ?18.00 for the use of a wheelchair and lift to get onto the plane.
                    I realise it is the Airlines that take the flak for this, but I believe it is the Airport authority that makes the charge??
                    I think he has an open and shut case, but the outcome will be interesting, and I believe the airline and airport are only contesting the case as this sets a precedent to supply a reasonable service for all disabled travellers, world wide.

                    When I worked for a tourism dot-com some years ago we weren't shy about suggesting that customers sue over this (it wasn't our company policy to do so, but individually we were outraged and didn't hide it).
                    IIRC the airlines are customers of the airport, not the passengers.
                    They charge the airlines for the use of the wheelchair lifts, I don't think any other airline passes the charge on the customer, whereas Ryan Air pass *everything* onto the customer.

                    Naturally you are forgiven :-)
                    Actually I think there are some potentially interesting legal ramifications
                    - if passing the cost of accessibility to the customer is found to be legal then it suggests a particular way to pay for what appeared to be already legally necessary accessibility improvements, at least in Australia and the UK.
                    But without providing some relevance to the topic of this list, which is web accessibility, I would prefer not to have more mail than I already get.
                    Fora for general discussion of accessibility law are available...

                    Many web authors make poor colour choices.
                    Some of these make pages unreadable to colour-impaired viewers.
                    Several browsers allow an override setting to be configured by the viewer.
                    DOES AMAYA ALLOW THE VIEWER TO OVERRIDE SETTING MADE INSIDE THE HTML DOCUMENTS
                    Being slightly blue/green impaired myself, I view this as an important accessibility feature that all browsers, including Amaya should include.

                    Not exactly, but Amaya is an editor and you can easily change or remove the background/foreground color.

                    John,
                    you could create your own local stylesheet, and make !imprtant declarations for colours.

                    charles' 5 line CSS tutorial...
                    to give a style to an element you list the element (called a selector in technical CSS writing), then in curly brackets you put the style feature you want to declare, a colon, and the value you want for that property.
                    example:
                    BODY { font-size: 24pt }
                    To set several properties at the same time, use a semi-colon between each declaration, inside the same set of curly brackets.
                    example:
                    H1 { font-size: 180% ; font-weight: bold ; line-height: 1.5em }
                    To make your statements override the ones that an author uses, add !important after each property declaration
                    example:
                    P { font-size: 12pt !important ; line-height: 2em !important }
                    NOTE: You should not do this in stylesheets that you publish, only your local stylesheet for reading, until the CSS2 cascade order is widely implemented.
                    If your browser uses the CSS2 cascade order, this will be fine.
                    If not, then an author who has published a style sheet with !important will override yours. (sigh)
                    I don't know which cascade Amaya uses.
                    It does allow you to disable any style sheet attached to a document, which is a handy feature.
                    Cheers

                    I have used a stylesheet which works ok on my own editing at at my own site and on those where people are kind enough to let one choose for themself.
                    Unfortunately once someone's site chooses a color you are stuck with it...
                    I am suggesting that an override be provided as an ACCESSIBILITY issue.
                    Amaya can lead the way on this as it does on several other issues such as MathML.
                    Thanks for suggestion.
                    It took a while to get amaya.css going as at first i thought it had to have tags ala html
                    --- this worked on other browsers but not in amaya
                    --- dropped any html tags and it worked like charm.
                    I had better buy a better reference
                    -- one by que fails....

                    Chris Lilley, Brian Stell and others have been discussing the rash of irate, &amp;quot;get me off this list&amp;quot; mesages the listserv has received, lately.
                    Well, folks: YOU CAN'T UNSUBSCRIBE FROM THIS LIST!
                    I've tried for 2 months to get off this list, I've followed the rules, I've tried variations of the theme, looking for some hidden code--all to no avail.
                    So, the last resort of those who have tried everything else is to post to the list they want to be rid of.
                    It's irony, but it's a fact.
                    PLEASE GET ME OFF THIS LIST@!%$#$/-\%

                    Please remain calm.
                    Our automated list manager works very well.
                    Sometimes there are problems due to:
                    - you being subscribed under another name/address --
                    this was the case for the first among the two recent messages.
                    - you being subscribed to a mail exploder in the company you work for --
                    this, I believe, was the case for the second person.
                    Please talk to your sysadm about this problem --
                    there is nothing we can do

                    It is possible that you are on another mailing list that is sending you the www-font messages.
                    If you're on an internal mailing list where you work, for instance, and someone subscribed that list to the www-font list, you may be getting it indirectly, in which case unsubscribing yourself will not get you off the list.

                    Thanks for the helpful info, but I just received a message saying that I have been removed from the list.
                    Why?
                    Because I posted my difficulties to the list.
                    Sorry I had to burden you all with my problems, but as you can see, it worked.
